                <p>In this project we were to create a campaign that addresses a serious issue that teens are facing today. We had to create a way that would spread awareness of  the issue that the group chooses. I was in a group of four people, and we had chosen the topic of Negative Judgment. For our project we decided to do a PSA an instagram page and a takeaway bookmark item. Our instagram was set up to have pictures that related to anti-Negative Judgment. Our bookmark was a simple design so that it would be easy to make. I was in charge of organizing the video and editing it. We then ,altogether, had to present in front of a crowd in a "gallery walk" type style, much like the senior showcase format. We presented around 20 times that day each time giving the same presentation. This project was able to teach us the basics of presenting and as well as sharpening our skills as a presenter.</p>

                <p>For this project, we had to create and design an app. We had to design a logo, map a layout, gather responses on the app idea, and make a kickstarter video to promote the app. Our app idea had to our original, it can't be anything that has already been made and it can't be anything similar to it. We then had to present our app idea to the class everything from the logo to the kickstarter. We worked together as a team very well, everyone did their job and we all worked hard. We all did our own part, my part was putting together the kickstarter, acting and script making. We recieved lots of positive feedback, we presented very good as a team and our grade showed for it.</p>

                <p>In this project our goal was to show our knowledge of Adobe Illustrator and create a self portrait of ourselves. To start we had to take a picture of ourselves and place it into illustrator. By ourselves we had to trace over ourselves and create our own Portrait on Illustrator. We had no external help we had to use Ilustrator and make the portrait as lifelike as possible. This project greatly sharpened my skills in Adobe Illustrator, it allowed me to work on my skills and improve upon them. It was a fun and simple easy project.</p>

This project let us see if we could use all our resources at our disposal. We had to use Illustrator, Foam core, and had to create a video. This really tested if we could use our time and all our resources wisely.
